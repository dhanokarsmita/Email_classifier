# Email-Spam-or-Not
Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.  Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.


• run nblearn.py on the entire training data,
• run nbclassify.py on the dev data using the resulting model
• use nbevaluate.py to measure performance and add the results to your report.
